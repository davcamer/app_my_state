a couple of alternatives:
- GMarkers of each category in their own list. Show/Hide them by walking the list.
- GMarkers of each category in their own list. Show/Hide them by adding/removing from a single MM.
- current: each category has an MM, but not sure how to show/hide a category. clear/add?


things to do:
- pictures of each category, shown in the detail bubble
- more straight info in the detail bubbles
- icons for each category
- toggle categories on/off
- adjust the zoom level at which categories are visible??
- get a proxy working for the GMaps
